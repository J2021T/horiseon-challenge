## Description of Steps

### Step 1: Added alt attributes to all img's for accessibility.

### Step 2: Updated all elements to the correct semantics.

 - Changed first div with class header to simply Header.  
 - I changed the second div to nav because it has the links to navigate to the page. 
 - I then spaced out between the hero div and renamed the next div section.
 - For the three div's in the first section I renamed them article.
 - Spaced out between the content section and the next div, which I renamed section.
 - Changed last div to footer.

### Step 3: Cleaned up index.html
- Changed title to Horiseon
- Added an id for SEO article so link from header could work.
- Removed unnecessary classes from articles in content section.
- Removed unnecessary classes from benefits divs.

### Step 4: Updated and Cleaned up style.css
- Updated syntax to reflect semantics changes in index file.
- Organized the css into parts of the page and noted them
- Consolidated duplicated code into single blocks for content, benefits, and articles
