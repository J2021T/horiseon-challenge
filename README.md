# Horiseon Challenge: Refactor Starter Code

## Description of Steps

### Step 1: Added alt attributes to all img's for accessibility.

### Step 2: Updated all elements to the correct semantics.
 -Changed first div with class header to simply Header.  
 -I changed the second div to nav because it has the links to navigate to the page. 
 -I then spaced out between the hero div and renamed the next div section.
 -For the three div's in the first section I renamed them article.
 -Spaced out between the content section and the next div, which I renamed section.
 -Changed last div to footer.

### Step 3: Cleaned up index.html
-Added an id for SEO article so link from header could work.
-Removed unnecessary classes from articles in content section.
-Removed unnecessary classes from benefits divs.
-Updated benefits divs to articles (missed in step 2)

### Step 4: Updated and Cleaned up style.css
-Updated syntax to reflect semantics changes in index file.
